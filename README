## Overview
Welcome to my game prototype! This project showcases my Java development skills, with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and rigorous JUnit testing. It serves as a testament to my commitment to creating reliable and well-structured Java applications.

## Technical Stack
The game prototype leverages a strong technical stack to ensure a reliable and engaging gaming experience:
- **Java**: Java is the heart of this project, enabling robust back-end development and emphasizing OOP principles.
- **Gradle**: The build automation tool Gradle streamlines project management and dependency handling.
- **JUnit Testing**: Rigorous JUnit testing is implemented to maintain the reliability and stability of the game prototype.
